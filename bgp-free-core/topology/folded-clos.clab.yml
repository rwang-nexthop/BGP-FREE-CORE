# Topology Name: folded-clos
# Description: A folded clos network topology with 6 SONiC nodes and 2 host nodes
#              - 4 leaf nodes (LRH-Q3D-0, LRH-Q3D-1, LRH-Q3D-2, LRH-Q3D-3)
#              - 2 spine nodes (URH-TH5-0, URH-TH5-1)
#              - 2 host nodes (host1 connected to Q3D-0 & Q3D-1, host2 connected to Q3D-2 & Q3D-3)
#              Each leaf is connected to both spines (full mesh)
#              VXLAN tunnel established between host1 and host2
